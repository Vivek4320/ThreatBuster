📋 Overview
AI-NGFW is a next-generation firewall solution addressing AICTE Problem Statement ID 25160. It combines deep learning, Zero Trust principles, and federated intelligence to detect and mitigate modern cyber threats in real-time.
Key Features

🧠 AI-Powered Detection - Sub-second threat identification with CNNs and anomaly detection
🔐 Zero Trust Enforcement - Continuous verification with micro-segmentation and RBA
🔍 Encrypted Traffic Analysis - TLS 1.3 and QUIC inspection with <1ms latency
🌐 Federated Learning - Privacy-preserving collaborative threat intelligence
⚡ Automated Response - SOAR integration with reinforcement learning optimization
📊 Unified Dashboard - Real-time analytics with SIEM/SOAR platform integration

Problem Addressed
Traditional firewalls cannot handle:

Polymorphic malware and zero-day exploits
80%+ encrypted network traffic (TLS/SSL)
AI-driven offensive tools and adversarial attacks
Dynamic cloud-native and IoT/IIoT environments
